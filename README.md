## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript

This landing page was created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JS. This project aims to create a mobile-first experience that scales seamlessly to tablet and desktop screens.

To make the project lightweight and efficient, I used Tailwind CSS. My goal was to create a responsive page that was visually pleasing in all screen sizes.

## Optimizations
Optimizations:

Functional forms: In the future, I plan to make the forms submit user info and store it in a database like MongoDB or PostgressSQL. 

## Lessons Learned:

Through this project, I gained valuable experience working with Tailwind CSS, which was a new technology for me. While I already had a good understanding of regular CSS and Bootstrap, learning the syntax for Tailwind CSS wasn't difficult. I found it a welcoming change from writing CSS and sometimes even using bootstrap.
